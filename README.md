# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education level, job title, and other relevant attributes. The model is built using machine learning techniques and aims to assist HR departments and recruiters in estimating fair compensation.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict salaries using historical data. This can help businesses in:

- Offering competitive salaries
- Budget planning
- Talent acquisition strategies

---

## 🧠 Features Used

- Years of Experience
- Education Level (Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD, etc.)
- Job Title / Position
- Industry
- Location
- Skills

> *Note: The actual features may vary based on the dataset used.*

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` (data manipulation)
  - `NumPy` (numerical operations)
  - `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` (data visualization)
  - `Scikit-learn` (modeling and evaluation)

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Import salary dataset (CSV, JSON, or scraped data).
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Convert categorical data using encoding, normalize numerical features.
4. **Model Building** – Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. **Model Evaluation** – Use metrics like R² Score, MAE, RMSE.
6. **Prediction** – Predict salary based on new input data.

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model              | R² Score | RMSE    |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression | 0.82     | 5000    |
| Random Forest     | 0.89     | 3500    |

*These are example values. Actual performance may vary.*
